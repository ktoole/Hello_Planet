# Hello_Planet
This is my first repo on GitHub!!!

I a computer science major at Berea College.  The majority of my programming interests as of now, lie in Android App Development.  I love to play video games, watch anime, and take things apart.  

As far as programming languages go, I know Python, Java, and Android the most.  I have dabbled in other languages such as C, C++ and JavaScript.

My top five favorite animes are:

One Piece,
One Punch Man,
Attack on Titan,
Gurren Lagaan,
Akame ga Kill

As far as video games go, I am a Playstation kid at heart and always will be.  I have a few Playstation 3 games and I still have my Playstation 2.  I plan on getting a Playstation 4 within the next few months.

I've enjoyed taking things apart since I was little.  My family would get annoyed whenever I asked to take something of value apart so that I could study its contents.  I think this is what led me to programming since the possibilities of what you can do with programming are basically unlimited.

If you want to know more about me, then message me.
